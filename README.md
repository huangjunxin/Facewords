# 语见单词 (Facewords)

A personalized vocabulary-building tool based on natural language materials built with Flutter.

利用Flutter建立的基于自然语料的个人生词库构建工具

*This is my final assignment for the Android development course.*

Current version: Alpha 0.6.38

## 1. Inspiration

As a language learner, I often come across unfamiliar words in my daily life. While I can look up their meaning in a dictionary, it can be difficult to organize and review these words later. This is particularly challenging when learning small languages. Research suggests that memorizing words in context is more effective, so I decided to create an app that would assist with personalized vocabulary building.

## 2. Features

- **Tokenization**: Extract new words from long texts such as news paragraphs and chat histories.
